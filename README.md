# monitoring-api

> API clients to showcase the RESTful API of the monitoring framework


## Summary

This module includes a minimal API written in C to register with the
monitoring server, and then send metric data for a given user, application, and
experiment ID. A full documentation of the RESTful API of the monitoring
server can be found in the [Web page][api].


## Prerequisites

The monitoring API requires first a running server and database. In order to
install these requirements, please checkout the associated [monitoring server][server], first. Please note that the installation and setup steps mentioned below assume
that you are running a current Linux as operating system. We have tested the
monitoring API with Ubuntu 15.10.

Before you can proceed, please clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/excess-project/monitoring-api.git
```


### Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies to be installed:

| Component         | Homepage                    | Version   |
|------------------ |---------------------------  |---------  |
| curl              | http://curl.haxx.se/        | >= 7.37   |


To ease the process of setting up a development environment, we provide a basic
script that downloads all dependencies, installs them locally in the project
directory, and then performs some clean-up operations. Thus, compiling the
monitoring API can be performed in a sandbox without affecting your current
operating system.

Executing the following script

```bash
./setup.sh
```

results in a new directory named `bin`, which holds the required dependencies
for compiling the project.


## Installation

This section assumes that you've successfully installed all required dependencies as described in the previous paragraphs.

```bash
$ make
$ make install
```


## Project Structure

The compiled monitoring API library is found in the folder `lib`. A simple example
of how to use the library is found in the `test` folder. The corresponding
binary is called `test_mf_api`.


## Acknowledgment

Framework Programme (FP7/2013-2016) under grant agreement number 611183. We are
